# Radiooooo download button
Adds a download button to [Radiooooo](https://radiooooo.com/)

## Description
I've discovered a lot of gems on Radiooooo and have many times wished I could save them. This extension allows for exactly that by adding a download button next to the 'play' and 'skip' buttons.
Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š

\* Due to limitations arising from security, I can't rename the filename to the name of the song, so you have to name it appropriately yourself once it's downloaded.
